## Task 1: Hangman Game

**Objective**: Create a text-based Hangman game.  
The game selects a random word, and the player must guess one letter at a time to reveal the word. Incorrect guesses are limited, and the game ends when the player either wins or runs out of guesses.

### Features:
- Random word selection from a predefined list
- Limit on incorrect guesses
- Visual representation of the hangman

**Files**:
- [`hangman.py`](./hangman.py)

## Task 2: Stock Portfolio Tracker

**Objective**: Build a stock portfolio tracker that allows users to manage and track their stock investments in real-time.  
This tool interacts with financial APIs to retrieve real-time stock prices and calculates the total portfolio value based on user-defined stock holdings.

### Features:
- Add and remove stocks
- Fetch current stock prices using financial APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance)
- Display the total value of the portfolio

**Files**:
- [`portfolio_tracker.py`](./portfolio_tracker.py)

## Task 3: Basic Chatbot

**Objective**: Implement a text-based chatbot that can engage in conversations using natural language processing.  
The chatbot uses libraries like NLTK or spaCy to simulate human-like conversations and respond to user input.

### Features:
- Pattern-based responses
- Integration with NLP libraries (NLTK, spaCy)

**Files**:
- [`chatbot.py`](./chatbot.py)

## Task 4: Task Automation with Python Scripts

**Objective**: Automate a repetitive task using Python scripts.  
This task demonstrates the automation of routine operations, such as file management or data cleaning, using Python.

### Features:
- Automation of routine tasks
- Python scripting for improved efficiency

**Files**:
- [`automation.py`](./automation.py)
